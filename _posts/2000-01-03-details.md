## Setup as a submodule

- Simple as using a `git` [command](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)!
- Go to your project's folder.
- Just run `git submodule add https://github.com/StevenThuriot/Horizon.git`

And you're done! Ready, start, go! Back to work!

-------------------------


## Setup as standalone project

- Horizon is also maintained as a DLL.
	- Or an actual project, if that's what you fancy!
- Exposing only the absolute minimum!
- For your pleasure…
- Hop on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenThuriot/Horizon-project) and get your fix, today!
