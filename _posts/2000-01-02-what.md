#### Basically

# Reflection is hardâ€¦ And dreadfully slow!

Horizon fixes these issues by supplying a *simple API*.

Underneath the covers, Horizon will create and cache **Expression Trees**. This means there will be a small *one time hit*. From then on, Horizon will be **blazing** fast!

As if that wasn't enough, Horizon also supports the *DLR's Binders*! This means it is easy to plug into your very own *DynamicObject*s! Hooray!
