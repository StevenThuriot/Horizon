## Contributing to Horizon

Want to hack on Horizon? Awesome! 

### Got a Question or Problem?

If you have questions about how to use Horizon, feel free to contact through GitHub.

### Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. 

Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. 

Pull Request will also be accepted!

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following:

* Search [GitHub][pulls] for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```

Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `Horizon:master`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push origin my-fix-branch -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```
