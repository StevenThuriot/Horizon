## Getting Started with Horizon

Everything you need is in the `Horizon` namespace, so start by including it

```csharp
using Horizon;
```

The easiest starting point is the static `Info` class. It requires a generic parameter. The generic is the type you want to query for info.

Imagine we want to resolve the value of the field `_randomField`.

```csharp
var value = Info<T>.GetField("_randomField");
```

A static constructor will be loaded at this point, caching the information about this type once. At this point, the execution trees won't be compiled just yet, to keep the hit as small as possible. A simple [`GetMembers`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k2w5ey1e.aspx) call is launched to get all the available info for the current type. This is parsed and converted to metadata Horizon can understand and work with.

A generic type is not always a possibility. Horizon can also auto-resolve using an existing instance, instead. Continuing our previous example, it would look like this.

```csharp
var @class = new ClassWithFields();
var value = Info.GetField(@class, "_randomField");
```

For ease of use, it can also be invoked as an extension method.

```csharp
var value = @class.GetField("_randomField");
```
